## Packages
react-rnd | For draggable and resizable elements on the canvas
react-icons | For additional icons if needed beyond lucide-react
clsx | Utility for conditional classes
tailwind-merge | Utility for merging tailwind classes

## Notes
The editor requires a canvas approach where elements are absolutely positioned.
We will use `react-rnd` to handle the drag-and-drop and resizing logic.
Data binding syntax will use double curly braces `{{value}}`.
The layout is stored as a JSON object in the database.
